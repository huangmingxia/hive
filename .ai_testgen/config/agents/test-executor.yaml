role:
  title: "OpenShift QE"
  specialization: "Manual test execution and E2E test execution with validation"
  responsibility: "Execute manual test shell scripts and E2E tests with comprehensive validation for {jira_issue_key}"

task:
  primary_goal: "Execute comprehensive test execution workflow including E2E tests"

  steps:
    # STEP 1: Environment Validation
    - "Load cluster configuration from environment variables or default paths"
    - "Set KUBECONFIG environment variable to configured kubeconfig_path"
    - "Check cluster availability and connectivity (oc, cluster access)"
    - "Verify required tools are installed and accessible"
    - "Validate cluster permissions and namespace access"
    - "Test cluster connectivity with basic kubectl commands"

    # STEP 2: E2E Test Execution
    - "Check if E2E test results file exists: test_artifacts/{COMPONENT}/{JIRA_KEY}/phases/{JIRA_KEY}_openshift_private_e2e_results.md"
    - "If no results file, navigate to E2E repository `.ai_testgen/temp_repos/openshift-tests-private` and check git commit history for {JIRA_KEY} related commits"
    - "If commits exist, check git status and current branch for any {JIRA_KEY} related changes"
    - "Search for existing E2E test code in current repository using grep/find for {JIRA_KEY}"
    - "Navigate to E2E repository directory or use current directory if tests are local"
    - "Build and verify test environment by running 'make all' to ensure everything is properly compiled"
    - "Create output directory: mkdir -p ../../test_artifacts/{COMPONENT}/{JIRA_KEY}/test_execution_results"
    - |
      MANDATORY: Execute actual test command: `./bin/extended-platform-tests run all --dry-run|grep "{JIRA_KEY}"|./bin/extended-platform-tests run --timeout 100m -f - --output-file ../../test_artifacts/{COMPONENT}/{JIRA_KEY}/test_execution_results/{JIRA_KEY}_test_execution_log.txt`
    - "CRITICAL: Wait for test execution to complete and capture real exit code"
    - "REQUIRED: Verify real log file exists with actual test output (not simulated content)"
    - "MANDATORY: If test failed with any errors (exit code != 0), MUST proceed to Test Result Analysis and Auto-Fix subtask"
    - "FORBIDDEN: Skipping auto-fix workflow for any test failure type"

    # STEP 3: Test Result Analysis + Auto-Fix after test execution + Re-execute test with corrections 
    - "MANDATORY: Analyze the test execution log file for specific error messages"
    - "Use DeepWiki MCP to analyze correct command syntax and patterns for the specific failure"
    - "INTELLIGENT ERROR ANALYSIS: Extract all error messages, stack traces, and failure points from logs"
    - "Analyze error messages and determine root causes with HIERARCHICAL classification"
    - "EXECUTION PATHS: IF CLASSIFIED AS E2E CODE/CONFIG ISSUE ‚Üí Attempt auto-fix; IF CLASSIFIED AS PRODUCT BUG ‚Üí Create bug report"
    - "MANDATORY: Apply corrections to the test code files and re-execute test with corrections"
    - "REQUIRED: Update test report with auto-fix attempts, classification, and results"

    # STEP 4: Update Test Coverage Matrix
    - "MANDATORY: Read test_artifacts/{COMPONENT}/{JIRA_KEY}/test_coverage_matrix.md"
    - "MANDATORY: Parse test execution log to extract test results for each Test Case ID"
    - "MANDATORY: Update Status column in test_coverage_matrix.md based on execution results:"
    - "  ‚úÖ Passed - Test executed successfully (exit code 0, no failures)"
    - "  ‚ùå Failed - Test executed but failed (exit code != 0, test failures)"
    - "  ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped - Test not executed (not found in execution log)"
    - "  üîÑ Retried - Test failed initially but passed after auto-fix"
    - "  üêõ Product Bug - Test failed due to product defect (not test issue)"
    - "MANDATORY: Calculate coverage metrics:"
    - "  - Total scenarios defined in matrix"
    - "  - Scenarios executed (Passed + Failed + Retried + Product Bug)"
    - "  - Scenarios not executed (Skipped)"
    - "  - Pass rate = (Passed + Retried) / Executed * 100%"
    - "  - Execution coverage = Executed / Total * 100%"
    - "MANDATORY: Write updated test_coverage_matrix.md with new status values"
    - "MANDATORY: Add coverage summary section at the end of matrix file"
