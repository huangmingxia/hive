**Description:** This test case verifies that a valid User Defined Function (UDF) can be registered and used in a query without causing a NullPointerException.
**Type:** E2E
**Priority:** High

#### Prerequisites
- A running Hive instance.
- A test table with some data.

#### Test Steps

   **Expected:** The jar file is created successfully.
2. **Action:** Register the UDF in Hive using the `CREATE FUNCTION` command.
   **Expected:** The function is registered successfully without any errors.
3. **Action:** Execute a `SELECT` query that uses the registered UDF.
   **Expected:** The query executes successfully and returns the correct result.

### Test Case HIVE-2544_E2E_002
**Name:** Attempt to register an invalid UDF
**Description:** This test case verifies that attempting to register a UDF with a non-existent class fails gracefully with an appropriate error message.
**Type:** E2E
**Priority:** High

#### Prerequisites
- A running Hive instance.

#### Test Steps
1. **Action:** Attempt to register a UDF with a class that does not exist in the provided jar file.
   **Expected:** Hive returns an error message indicating that the class was not found, and no NullPointerException is thrown.

### Test Case HIVE-2544_E2E_003
**Name:** Attempt to register a UDF with a name that is already in use
**Description:** This test case verifies that attempting to register a UDF with a name that is already registered fails gracefully with an appropriate error message.
**Type:** E2E
**Priority:** Medium

#### Prerequisites
- A running Hive instance.
- A UDF is already registered with a specific name.

#### Test Steps
1. **Action:** Attempt to register another UDF with the same name as an existing UDF.
   **Expected:** Hive returns an error message indicating that the function name is already in use, and no NullPointerException is thrown.
